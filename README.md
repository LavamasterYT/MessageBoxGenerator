# MessageBoxGenerator

## Whats this?

This is a WPF and C# application that allows you to create a custom message box. For example, if you want to prank your friends and have it say "Sorry, but this PC won't respond because you are using it.", in a Windows message box, you can. You can customize the title of the message box, message, icon, and buttons. (There are some presets since its generating from Windows, so you cant have buttons say "Why?" and stuff.).
